# GB-001 Game Board
I recently picked up a copy of *6502 Games* by the author of a lot of great books about the 6502-processor, the one and only Rodnay Zaks. Wanted to write the late, great Rodnay Zaks though as far as Wikipedia has been updated he's still alive so I'll have to settle with *"great"*.  Love his books, so it was an obvious purchase though I had to have it sent half-way across the world to get it - Canada to Norway, so it basically went from one icy tundra to another one! You however don't need the physical book to enjoy it, I'm just old-fashioned that way, as there's a digitized copy available on [archive.org](https://archive.org/details/6502GamesRodnayZaks/mode/2up).

I was unsure of whether or not to include the game board as it contradicts the overall goal of this repository (Project Board), but decided for it as the project is definitely in the spirit of the project (and it's my project, so I get to decide). Despite not fitting on a standard platform board, I opted for going with the notion that it uses a lot of the same components and shares the general nature of being usable on all of my 6502-based computers.
