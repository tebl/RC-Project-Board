# RC-ONE
The following subfolders contain versions of the games found in the book *6502 Games* by Rodnay Zaks, the code has been altered to run on the RC-ONE computer (65K expansion needed). I'm using SB-Assembler 3, a different assembler might have differences in syntax though you should be able to use the Intel HEX-files directly if you don't want to make alterations to the code as you go along.

You will need some way of getting the code onto the computer, my weapon of choice for this project is the ExRAM expansion jumpered so that it provides memory in the area from $2000 to $3FFF. Code is uploaded to the ExRAM by pasting the HEX-files into the terminal window, this would usually copy the code into the area from $2200 and upwards. In order to get the program code from there and to the regular $0200 starting address, I start by uploading the FBK-Movit program and then start execution at $3F70 to copy the program. At this point you'll be ready to start the game, so just run it from $0200 as usual. The advantage of doing it this way is that you can keep playing the previous game while the ExRAM is receiving data for the next one!
